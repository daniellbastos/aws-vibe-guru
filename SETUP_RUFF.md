# Ruff Setup - Code Quality Configuration 🚀

## ✅ What was configured

### 1. Ruff Installation
- Added `ruff>=0.1.0` to dev dependencies
- Added `isort>=5.12.0` for import sorting compatibility
- Added `pytest>=7.0.0` and `pytest-cov>=4.0.0` for testing

### 2. Ruff Configuration in pyproject.toml
```toml
[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py38"
line-length = 88

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [
    "E",   # pycodestyle errors
    "W",   # pycodestyle warnings
    "F",   # pyflakes
    "I",   # isort
    "C",   # flake8-comprehensions
    "B",   # flake8-bugbear
    "UP",  # pyupgrade
]
ignore = [
    "E501",  # line too long, handled by formatter
    "B008",  # do not perform function calls in argument defaults
    "C901",  # too complex
]

[tool.ruff.format]
quote-style = "double"
indent-style = "space"
skip-magic-trailing-comma = false
line-ending = "auto"

[tool.ruff.lint.isort]
known-first-party = ["aws_toolbelt"]
```

### 3. Makefile Commands Added
```makefile
# Development commands
lint:           # Check code with Ruff
lint-fix:       # Fix code issues automatically
format:         # Format code with Ruff
format-check:   # Check if code is formatted
quality:        # Run both lint and format
test:           # Run pytest
install-dev:    # Install dev dependencies
clean:          # Clean cache files
```

### 4. VS Code Configuration
- Added `.vscode/settings.json` for consistent development experience
- Configured Ruff as default linter and formatter
- Enabled format on save and organize imports

### 5. Code Formatting Applied
- **cli.py**: Imports reorganized and formatted
- **cli_helpers.py**: Imports reorganized and function parameters formatted
- All files now follow consistent style

## 🎯 Current Code Quality Status

### ✅ All checks passing
```bash
$ make quality
uv run ruff check src/
All checks passed!
uv run ruff format src/
4 files left unchanged
✅ Code quality checks completed
```

### 📊 Configured Rules
- **pycodestyle** (E, W): Python style guide enforcement
- **pyflakes** (F): Logical errors detection
- **isort** (I): Import sorting and organization
- **flake8-comprehensions** (C): List/dict comprehension improvements
- **flake8-bugbear** (B): Common bug patterns
- **pyupgrade** (UP): Modern Python syntax suggestions

## 🚀 How to Use

### Daily Development
```bash
# Before committing
make quality        # Check and format all code

# During development
make lint          # Quick check
make format        # Format code
```

### IDE Integration
- VS Code will automatically format on save
- Ruff extension provides real-time linting
- Imports are organized automatically

### CI/CD Ready
```bash
# In CI pipeline
make lint          # Fail if code doesn't meet standards
make format-check  # Fail if code isn't formatted
```

## 📋 Benefits

### 🏃‍♂️ Speed
- **Ruff is 10-100x faster** than traditional tools
- Replaces multiple tools: black, isort, flake8, pyupgrade
- Instant feedback during development

### 🎯 Consistency
- Enforced code style across the project
- Automatic import organization
- Modern Python syntax suggestions

### 🔧 Developer Experience
- Single tool for multiple checks
- Clear error messages
- Auto-fix capabilities
